28. Concatenation of the two strings.
Question: Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns a new string that is the concatenation of the two strings.
Hint: Use the + operator or a built-in string concatenation method (if your language has one).
Sample Input: "Hello", "World"
Sample Output: "HelloWorld"


string1 = input("Enter 1st string: ")
string2 = input("Enter 2nd string: ")

print(string1+string2)
